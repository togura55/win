In case of using Intel Stick, you may want to run WdPublisher application automatically after booting the stick PC up. The configuration shows in below, 
- Login W10 w/o password: Cofigure by 'netplwiz'
- Setting up the autorun for WdPublisher: Run 'shell:startup' and 'shell:appsfolder' by Win-R, and then drag&drop an app icon to the startup folder.

Guid in use of BackgroundTasks is for the WdPublisher package only. Therefore, WdPublisher.UWP standalone executable could not use of it because already registerd the Windows.  This guid is defined in the Configure.cs source code both for WdPublisher.UWP and Tasks.
