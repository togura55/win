If a part is constructed of, or includes, high-strength steel, observe the following important guidelines:</ptxt></trans></sie_bunmyaku><sie_bunmyaku bunmyakucode="3"><trans><ptxt>High-strength steel is more rigid and has more memory than traditional steel, making it more difficult to straighten. To prevent further body damage when using frame straightening equipment, apply pulling force gradually and closely monitor body dimensions during the straightening process to ensure the body dimensions are returned to the proper specifications.</ptxt></trans></sie_bunmyaku><sie_bunmyaku bunmyakucode="4"><trans><fig-text-grp><ptxt>NOTE: DO NOT apply heat, such as an oxyacetylene torch, to any body part during straightening. This may compromise the internal structure and strength of high-strength steel parts. Any of these parts that had heat applied to them during straightening MUST be replaced with new parts. Ignoring these instructions may significantly reduce occupant protection in any subsequent collision.</ptxt><figure><graphic/></figure></fig-text-grp></trans></sie_bunmyaku><sie_bunmyaku bunmyakucode="6"><trans><ptxt>Use a spot weld cutter or drill bit designed for <nodivide>high-strength</nodivide> steel to remove spot weld nuggets from the steel parts being removed. If the cutting performance of the spot cutter decreases, grind the spot cutter using a grinder as soon as possible. Or change the spot cutter to a new one.
